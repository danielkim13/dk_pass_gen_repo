<h2 align="center"><b>About the Project</b></h4>

<p>Create a password generator using JavaScript</p>

<hr />

<h4><u>User Story</u></h4>

    - AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
    I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
    SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

<h4><u>Acceptance Criteria</u></h4>

<p><b>GIVEN I need a new, secure password</b></p>

    - #1: WHEN I click the button to generate a password
          THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

    - #2: WHEN prompted for password criteria
          THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

    - #3: WHEN prompted for the length of the password
          THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

    - #4: WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
          THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

    - #5: WHEN I answer each prompt
          THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

    - #6: WHEN all prompts are answered
          THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

    - #7: WHEN the password is generated
          THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
